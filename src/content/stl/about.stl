# --- Hero ---

# --- Design Philosophy ---

[Page:About] -> [Content:Philosophy] ::mod(
  title="Design Philosophy",
  description="STL introduces a tension-path model for knowledge representation. Unlike flat key-value stores or hierarchical documents, STL captures directional semantic relations with built-in provenance and confidence. Every statement is a path from source to target, enriched with metadata that enables reasoning, verification, and trust calibration.",

# --- Core Syntax ---

[Page:About] -> [Content:Syntax] ::mod(
  title="Core Syntax",
  description="The fundamental form is simple: [Source] -> [Target] ::mod(key=value). Anchors represent entities or concepts. Arrows define directional relations. Modifiers carry metadata — confidence, provenance, temporality, causality.",

# --- Anchor Types ---

  title="Modifier System",
  description="Modifiers are the metadata layer of STL. Nine categories cover temporal, spatial, logical, provenance, affective, value, causal, cognitive, and mood dimensions. The most critical for LLMs: confidence (how certain), source (where from), and rule (what type of relation).",
