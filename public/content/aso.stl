# --- FAQ ---

[FAQ:What_Is_ASO] -> [Answer] ::mod(
  question="What is ASO?",
  answer="AI Search Optimization is the practice of structuring web content so that AI agents can understand, reason about, and act on it precisely. It is to AI agents what SEO is to search engines."
)

[FAQ:Replace_SEO] -> [Answer] ::mod(
  question="Does ASO replace SEO?",
  answer="No. ASO complements SEO. You still need SEO for traditional search engines. ASO adds a layer for AI agents. A well-optimized site can have both llms.txt (SEO for LLMs) and site.stl (full semantic ASO)."
)

[FAQ:How_To_Start] -> [Answer] ::mod(
  question="How do I start with ASO?",
  answer="Create a site.stl file at /.well-known/site.stl on your website. Declare your site identity, content map, and agent policies. AI agents will discover it automatically."
)

[FAQ:LLM_Understand] -> [Answer] ::mod(
  question="Can LLMs actually read STL?",
  answer="Yes. STL is designed to be human-readable, and LLMs are excellent readers. No special parser is needed for comprehension. LLMs understand STL syntax natively — tested with both large and small models."
